# LibrarySim

A simulation of a real world library website, with promotional info and a database to "checkout" books and view their availability.

After graduating, I decided to keep myself occupied and learning by taking more coding courses online. I bought a bundle of courses in HTML, CSS, and Javascript from codewithmosh.com and worked through them. I had almost no experience with these languages in college, and found them to be very exciting to play around with. I had wanted to build a website for some years, and I decided I should build one now to implement many of the features I was learning. At the same time, I had wanted to build and manage a database from scratch, as I had some basic experience with MySQL and had taken a Database Design class but never really implemented my own from the ground up. Therefore, I figured that making a website for a library would strike a good balance between my desire for an interactive website, as people could make accounts and query the library's database for books. I used ChatGPT to provide me with fictional info (name, address, history) for a library and displayed it on the webpages. I then downloaded a cmv file of sample libary data to load into my library's database. I am currently still in the process of building this.

Update 8/25/23: As I am almost done setting up the user-interface for the home page along with the basic skeleton of the other web pages, I 've decided to start learning some backend technologies. I just purchased The Complete Node.js Course from codewithmosh.com and will be using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend of my application. I'm excited to be working towards the ability to register users, log in, and search for books from the database.

Update 9/5/23: Although I wanted to follow along to the course and implement a MongoDB database, I decided that a relational MySQL database made more sense for a library database. Therefore, I am now using MySQL to work with a phpMyAdmin database for all of the project data.

The carousel feature on the homepage was heavily based off of code from this follow along by Kevin Powell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYsVOamdB0g&t=1182s
