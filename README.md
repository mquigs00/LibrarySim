# LibrarySim
A simulation of a real world library website, with promotional info and a database to check the availability of products like books and cds.

After graduating, I decided to keep myself occupied and learning by taking more coding courses online. I bought a bundle of courses in HTML, CSS, and Javascript from codewithmosh.com and worked through them. I had almost no experience with these languages in college, and found them to be very exciting to play around with. I had wanted to build a website for some years, and I decided I should build one now to implement many of the features I was learning. At the same time, I had wanted to build and manage a database from scratch, as I had some basic experience with MySQL and had taken a Database Design class but never really implemented my own from the ground up. Therefore, I figured that making a website for a library would strike a good balance between my desire for an interactive website, as people could make accounts and query the library's database for books. I used ChatGPT to provide me with fictional info (name, address, history) for a library and displayed it on the webpages. I then downloaded a cmv file of sample libary data to load into my library's database. I am currently still in the process of building this.
